This plugin will replace the password strength indicator with a stronger version.

== Description ==

This plugin will replace the core WordPress password strength indicator with one that takes into
account a banned list of common passwords

It will also force strong passwords for administrators, and will not affect the other roles.

This plugin is influenced by the [Force Strong Passwords plugin ](https://github.com/gyrus/Force-Strong-Passwords)

The next version will look to include expiring passwords for administration level user accounts.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `dg-security` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
